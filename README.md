# i3 .files
This is the cloud storage for my daily driven i3 config run on arch linux. this repo is MAINLY for keeping an online copy of my files 
so dont expect this readme to be constantly updated as I do not have you other users in first mind.
## Installing 
I definitly did not keep size in mind when making this config so there are quite a few dependancys.
